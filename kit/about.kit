				<h1>My name is Sam!</h1>
			</div>
			<p>
				I've been called everything from Sam to Sma to Karen. I love trying to change things in the world in interesting ways, usually by building interactions with computers. I'm a fearsome perfectionist. I never finish my projects, I just sometimes stop typing for a while.
			</p>
			<p>
				I've designed robots, a stress meter, a PSA, and a garden featuring native Northeastern plants. When my fingers aren't pressing down buttons to record the strange thoughts that my brain produces I'm often listening to Welcome to Night Vale or caring for my garden.
			</p>
			<p>
				If you have some code you want me to look at or an idea worth considering, <a href="contact.html">contact me!</a> I'll respond whenever I get the chance.
