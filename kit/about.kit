				I love trying to change things in the world in interesting ways, usually by building interactions with computers. <span class="emphasis">I'm a perfectionist.</span>

				I think of design as more than just visible appearances. To me, <span class="emphasis">design is how something functions and how it feels</span> to the user, along with its appearance. I enjoy refining the appearance, the functionality, and the way my projects feel until I see nothing left to improve.
			</p>
			<p>
				I believe very strongly in the individual's rights to privacy. <span class="emphasis">I think government should serve the people</span>, and act in their interest. The people means everyone, not just those with wealth or power.
